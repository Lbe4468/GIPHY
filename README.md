# GIPHY

<p>This is a fun little GIF app that uses the Giphy API. Here is the documentation for the Giphy API: https://github.com/Giphy/GiphyAPI</p>
<p>I created an array of animals with corresponding buttons. When you click a button, 10 images are retrieved from GIPHY and displayed on the page. When you click on the image, the GIF plays. When you click again, the GIF stops playing. You can add a new button and then click on the button to retrieve GIFs of the animals you chose. The rating of each GIF will also appear on the page.</p>
